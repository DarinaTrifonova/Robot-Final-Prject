# Here in the Locators directory we should add all locators that we will use
# The specific locators that are required to go trough the user registration should be in this file according to the
# file name
# You should always prefer to use ID for locators if they are available.
# Locators should be as simple as possible but unique.
# Examples:
# top_navigation_sign_in_button = "xpath=//a[contains(@class,'login')]"
user_account_dropdown = "xpath = //a[@title='My Account']"
user_register_dropdown_option = "xpath = //a[contains(@href, 'register')]"
user_first_name_field = "id = input-firstname"
user_last_name_field = "id = input-lastname"
user_email_field = "id = input-email"
user_telephone_field = "id = input-telephone"
user_address_1_field = "id = input-address-1"
user_city_field = "id = input-city"
user_postcode_field = "id = input-postcode"
user_country_dropdown = "id = input-country"
user_state_dropdown = "id = input-zone"
user_password_field = "id = input-password"
user_password_confirm_field = "id = input-confirm"
privacy_policy_consent_checkox = "name = agree"
register_continue_button = "xpath = //input[@type='submit']"
